// How does it work?

// The WHERE clause filters the result set to only include rows where the following condition is true.
// imdb_rating > 8 is the condition. Here, only rows with a value greater than 8 in the imdb_rating column will be returned.
// The > is an operator. Operators create a condition that can be evaluated as either true or false.



SELECT *

SELECT *
FROM movies
WHERE imdb_rating < 5;

SELECT *
FROM movies
WHERE year > 2014;


// LIKE

SELECT *

WHERE name LIKE 'Se_en';
